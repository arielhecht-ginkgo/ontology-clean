Documentation on standardized naming and data organization [Ginkgo](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/)
uses to represent and analyze synthetic biology constructs. Effectively representing 
and communicating complex biological results requires structuring data with
context. We have these integrated knowledge representations:

- [Summarizing construct design information for preparing assay screens](./design_to_assay.md)
- [Identifying assay control samples](./representing_controls.md)
- [Establishing experimental intent with plate labels](./experimental_plate_labels.md)
- [Collecting measurements taken during assays](measurements.md)
- [Reporting results of an assay: activity and hit selection logic](./activity_reporting.md)
